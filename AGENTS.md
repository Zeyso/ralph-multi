# Ralph Agent Instructions

## Overview

Ralph is an autonomous AI agent loop that runs AI coding tools (Amp or Claude Code) repeatedly until all PRD items are complete. Each iteration is a fresh instance with clean context.

## Commands

```bash
# Run the flowchart dev server
cd flowchart && npm run dev

# Build the flowchart
cd flowchart && npm run build

# Run Ralph with Amp (default)
./ralph.sh [max_iterations]

# Run Ralph with Claude Code
./ralph.sh --tool claude [max_iterations]

# Run Ralph with custom agents (configured in ralph.config.json or via CLI args)
./ralph.sh --tool antigravity [max_iterations]
```

## Key Files

- `ralph.sh` - The bash loop that spawns fresh AI instances (agent-agnostic, supports any custom or preset tools)
- `ralph.config.json` - Configuration file for tool execution commands, input methods, and defaults
- `prompt.md` - Instructions given to each AMP instance (or custom agents by default)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions given to each Claude Code instance
- `prd.json.example` - Example PRD format
- `flowchart/` - Interactive React Flow diagram explaining how Ralph works

## Flowchart

The `flowchart/` directory contains an interactive visualization built with React Flow. It's designed for presentations - click through to reveal each step with animations.

To run locally:
```bash
cd flowchart
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Patterns

- Each iteration spawns a fresh AI instance (Amp or Claude Code) with clean context
- Memory persists via git history, `progress.txt`, and `prd.json`
- Stories should be small enough to complete in one context window
- Always update AGENTS.md with discovered patterns for future iterations
